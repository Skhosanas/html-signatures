Thanks for downloading our email signature template! We hope you enjoy using it.

Our templates have been minified in order to reduce the HTML character count. If you're installing this email signature in Gmail, we recommend leaving the template minified, even while modifying the HTML code. Otherwise, feel free to use an online HTML beautifier tool to make the HTML code more readable.

Because creating and modifying email signatures can be complex, we have published a post on how to do it, which can be found here: https://blog.gimm.io/how-to-create-an-html-email-signature
